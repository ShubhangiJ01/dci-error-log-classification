# Objective

In the current setup when a job fails we donâ€™t know if it failed because of DCI issue or issue is at partners end. As test cases are executed at partners end, error can be specifically caused because of issues in partners systems or networks. All these jobs have to be first checked by an RH developer and based on the error it is decided if it is an RH issue or partner issue.

To save time, we build an error log classification model using machine learning and NLP techniques . This model reads the job data and automatically classifies the failed log into DCI or non DCI. Once the job is classified, RH resources have to invest time only for jobs which are marked as DCI error type and all other jobs are redirected to corresponding partners.

## Classifier

The classifier is built using a rule based system in NLP. Rules are stored in the elasticsearch database. Below is the pipeline for the model development.

## Rules table Schema:

'Error_Type', type=str, default="None",choices=['non DCI','DCI'],help='Error label'  
'Job_ID', type=str, default="0", help='Test job id'  
'Stage_of_Failure', type=str, default="0",help='Task name at which job failed'  
'Error_Message', type=str, default="0",help='Error content'  
'Is_user_text', type=int,choices=[0,1],default=0, help='user_text.yml in failed bucket'  
'Is_SUT', type=int,choices=[0,1],default=0, help='SUT.yml in failed bucket'  
'Is_install', type=int,choices=[0,1],default=0, help='install.yml in failed bucket'  
'Is_logs', type=int,choices=[0,1],default=0, help='logs.yml in failed bucket'  
'Is_dci_rhel_cki', type=int,choices=[0,1],default=0, help='Failed task dci-rhel-cki'  

## New Rule creation

Flask API is created to create new rule. Entry point for the new rule creation is app.py @app.route('/rules', methods=['POST'])  
To create new rule, run the API : http POST http://0.0.0.0:1234/rules <parameter_1="value>-----<parameter_n="value">  
Sample for parameters in above command: 
Stage_of_Failure = "Run the pre-run hook" 
Error_Type = "non DCI" 
Is_SUT = "1"

## Testing new rule

Entry point for the rule testing is app.py @app.route('/rules/test', methods=['POST'])  
Command to test the rule : http POST http://0.0.0.0:1234/rules/test <parameter_1="value>-----<parameter_n="value">  
Parameters should be corresponding to the job id passed for testing the rule. 

## Search existing rules

Entry point for the getting list of all rules present in database is app.py @app.route('/rules', methods=['GET'])  
Command to search the rule : http GET  http://0.0.0.0:1234/rules
